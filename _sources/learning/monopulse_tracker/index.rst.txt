Scalable Phased Array & Adaptive RF Systems Enabled by ADI DataX ™
================================================================================

Complex RF needs a faster path from idea to array. ADI DataX accelerates
Software Defined Radio (SDR) systems-based development by simplifying evaluation
across platforms like ADALM‑PHASER, Jupiter SDR, and Talise SOM. These platforms
support synchronized MIMO scaling and rapid prototyping for complex RF
architectures. Designers can use various abstraction layers that streamline data
acquisition and system optimisation. This unified workflow speeds the creation
of adaptive, high‑performance RF solutions.

Demo description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This demo illustrates the implementation of a monopulse tracking system using 
ADI's DataX ™, showcasing the platform independecies and scalability of our 
systems. The demo consists of two main systems: the transmitter and the receiver
system. 

The transmitter system is using an :adi:`ADALM-PLUTO <adalm-pluto>` to 
generate an RF signal, which is then transmitted through a wideband vivaldi 
antenna.

The receiver system showcases two separate platform to showcase the capabilities
of DataX ™, and the ease of scaling and prototyping across different platforms.

The first receiver system is based on the :adi:`AD-JUPITER-EBZ <ad-jupiter-ebz>`,
which is a versatile software-defined platform based on :adi:`ADRV9002 <adrv9002>`
and Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. ADRV9002 is a new generation RF transceiver
that has dual-channel transmitters, dual-channel receivers covering 30 MHz to
6 GHz frequency range with very good RF linearity performance and a set of
advanced features like fast profiles switching, flexible power vs performance
configuration, fast frequency hopping, multi-chip synchronization and DPD for
narrow and wide band waveform. This demo heavily depends on the multi-chip
synchronization (MCS) capabilities of the ADRV9002, which allows the usage of
two :adi:`AD-JUPITER-EBZ <ad-jupiter-ebz>`, synchronized using the 
:adi:`AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ <ad-synchrona14-ebz>` to create a 4-channel receiver 
system.
The second receiver system is based on the :adi:`ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOM <adrv9009-zu11eg>`,
is a highly integrated RF System-On-Module(RF-SOM) based on the :adi:`ADRV9009 <adrv9009>`
and Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. The RF-SOM is a platform for evaluation and
prototyping. To use the RF-SOM a carrier board is required, the 
:adi:`ADRV2CRR-FMC <adrv2crr-fmc>` board is designed for this purpose.

As for the software, the demo is implemented using Holohub and Matlab. The
Holohub implementation is running on the Jupiter platform, while the Matlab
implementation is running on the RF-SOM platform. Both implementations are using
DataX ™, which allows for easy prototyping and scaling across different
platforms.

But what is Monopulse Tracking?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The name refers to its ability to extract range and direction from a single
signal pulse.
The method uses two simultaneous beams, the **SUM** and **DELTA** beams, to
compare the received signal's amplitude  and phase, enabling precise angle
estimation. This technique is widely used in radar and communication systems for
accurate target tracking and direction finding.

   Monopulse Tracking Concept

The **SUM** beam captures the total signal strength, while the **DELTA** beam
measures the difference in signal strength between the two halfs of the antenna
array. The **SUM** beam has a maximum when pointed directly towards the
transmitter, while the **DELTA** beam can be:

  - Δ ≈ 0, when the signal arrives from mechanical boresight
  - Δ > 0, when the signal arrives from the left of the mechanical  boresight
  - Δ < 0, when the signal arrives from the right of the mechanical boresight

Correlating the **SUM** and **DELTA** beams results and error, which is the
difference between the actual angle of arrival and the electrical boresight. By
calculating the phase difference of this error signal, the system can estimate
the angle of arrival of the incoming signal with high precision, even in
environments with significant noise and interference.

After the angle of arrival is estimated, the phased array can be electrically
steered to point towards the transmitter, by adjusting the phase of the signals
received by each antenna element.

.. important::
    The monopulse tracking technique is extremely sensitive to the phase and
    amplitude balance of the antenna array, as well as the calibration of the
    system. Any imbalance or miscalibration can lead to errors in the angle of
    arrival estimation, which can degrade the performance of the tracking system.

    Before doing the monopulse tracking, it is important to calibrate the system
    and make sure that you are using a well balanced antenna array.

SD Card Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- For the :adi:`ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOM <adrv9009-zu11eg>` platform, the boot 
  files are generated using the Using Kuiper Image:

  :external+adi-kuiper-gen:ref:`Writing the Image to an SD Card
  <use-kuiper-image>`

- For the Jupiter SDR platform, begin by writing the image to an SD card the
  same way as for the ADRV9009-ZU11EG, then copy the files from the following zip
  to the boot partition of the SD card:

    :download:`jupiter_mcs_sync.zip`

- For the :adi:`AD-SYNCHRONA14-EBZ <ad-synchrona14-ebz>`, the SD card should be
  flashed as before and the files from the following zip should be copied to the
  boot partition of the SD Card:

    :download:`synchrona_jupiter_mcs.zip`

- Lastly, for the :adi:`ADALM-PLUTO <adalm-pluto>`, the firmware should be 
  updated for which you can find the instructions here: 
  :dokuwiki:`Updating the Firmware <university/tools/pluto/users/firmware>`, and
  the files from the following zip should be copied to a flash drive:

    :download:`pluto_script.zip`
